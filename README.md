**Course:** IN00EP47-3002 Software Application Project  

## Project Overview

"Need For Rämä" is an arcade game inspired by the Finnish TV show *Speden Spelit*. The player presses a button corresponding to a lit LED. Points are awarded for accurate presses, while delays or mistakes result in no points. The game ends when the timer runs out or the player fails to keep up with the rhythm.

The theme of the project is "Cheshire Cat" from *Alice in Wonderland*, reflected in the game's design.

## Objectives

The primary goal was to develop a microcontroller-based application that uses sensors to monitor the environment and controls hardware accordingly. Additionally, the project emphasized teamwork, documentation, and project management skills.

## Tools and Components

- **Hardware:** Jump wires, push buttons, LEDs, resistors, a 7-segment display, and arcade-style buttons in the final design.
- **Software:** Arduino IDE and C++ for programming, utilizing interrupts and timers for functionality.

## Features

- Game starts with a start button, triggering LEDs to light up randomly.
- The player must press the corresponding button before the LED turns off.
- Additional elements include sound effects, a decorated enclosure, and visual enhancements.

## Results and Reflections

The project was completed successfully within the timeframe, meeting all functional requirements. The team added creative elements, such as painted designs and sound effects, enhancing the overall experience. Areas for improvement include time management and adding more advanced features.
